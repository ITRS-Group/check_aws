# Contributing to nagios_aws

Thanks for your interest in contributing to nagios_aws! Below follows a short set of contributing guidelines.

## Testing

We currently have a number of pytests, in the /tests directory. New code must in almost all cases, come with a suitable
set of tests. All tests are executed in our CI system (see more in the later section), and must pass for changes to be
approved.

## Commit messages

Before you submit your change, please take your time to write a thorough commit message. Chris Beams has written a very
good [blog post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rule)
with seven rules of a great commit message. Please follow these.

## Submitting your PR

All changes should be submitted as a PR on the GitHub project. After the PR has been submitted a member of the ITRS
Group development team will review the PR, suggest changes if necessary, and then merge the code to the master branch.

## CI System

We utilize two CI systems. Buildbot and Travis-CI. Buildbot is used internally at ITRS Group, and is not available
publicly. The results of the CI run from Buildbot can for community contributions be ignored. For a PR to be merged the
Travis-CI build must have executed without failures.

## LGTM

Further to using the CI systems above to run our test suite, we are using lgtm.com to analyze code. For a PR to be
merged, no new alerts should be flagged by LGTM.
